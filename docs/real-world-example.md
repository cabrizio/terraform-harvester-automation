## Real-World Example

A development team was preparing a new edge computing environment on Harvester. 
They needed to provision multiple Ubuntu VMs with consistent configuration and integrate them into their CI/CD workflows. 
Before, this process took hours of manual effort and often led to inconsistent setups across environments.  

By adopting **Terraform Harvester Automation**, the team reduced VM deployment time from **3 hours to under 15 minutes**. 
Using the optional Ansible integration, each VM was configured automatically with Docker, SSH keys, and monitoring agents. 
Finally, the built-in Jenkins pipeline ensured that infrastructure changes were tested, versioned, and deployed reliably.  

The result: **faster releases, fewer errors, and complete visibility** into their Harvester-based infrastructure.
